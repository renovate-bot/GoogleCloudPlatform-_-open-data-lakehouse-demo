    "This notebook will demonstrate a strategy to implement an open lakehouse on GCP, using Apache Iceberg, as an open source standard for managing data, while still leveraging GCP native capabilities. This demo will use BigQuery Manged Iceberg Tables, Managed Apache Kafka and Apache Kafka Connect to ingest streaming data, Vertex AI for Generative AI queries on top of the data and Dataplex to govern tables.\n",

    "For time-series forecasting, there are 3 main options to choose from.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ARIMA_PLUS\n",
    "This model is an enhanced version of the traditional ARIMA, offering improved performance and often including automatic parameter selection for better ease of use in forecasting univariate time series. It's a **Univariate** model, meaning, it is built to predict a target value based on only the timestamp variable. You cannot incorporate extra variables that might influence the prediction. For that reason, we will **NOT** use it here in our demo.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ARIMA_PLUS_XREG\n",
    "Extending `ARIMA_PLUS`, this model incorporates the ability to utilize external regressors (exogenous variables) to enhance the forecasting accuracy by accounting for the influence of other relevant time series. Like the `ARIMA_PLUS`, it still relies on linearity assumptions between regressors and target. It is a multivariate model, in terms of inputs, but still forecasts a single output.\n",
    "\n",
    "### TimesFM\n",
    "`TimesFM` is a deep learning-based forecasting model that leverages transformer architectures to capture complex temporal dependencies and long-range patterns in time series data, often excelling in multi-variate forecasting tasks. It's considered excellent at capturing complex non-linear patterns and long-range dependencies; naturally handles multivariate inputs and outputs; generally performs well on large datasets. It is known to overfit on small datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What's next?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the rest of this notebook, we will create predictions using `ARIMA_PLUS_XREG` and `TimesFM` and evaluate both models and compare their performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will create a summarized bus_rides table, aggregate the `demand_metric` by the hour, and use the linear time gaps filling strategy to train the ARIMA_PLUS_XREG model.\n"
