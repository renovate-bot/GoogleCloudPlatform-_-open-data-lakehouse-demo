    "# Ridership Open Lakehouse Demo (Part 2): Simulate Bus Rides using Apache Spark\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will demonstrate a strategy to implement an open lakehouse on GCP, using Apache Iceberg,\n",
    "as an open source standard for managing data, while still leveraging GCP native capabilities. This demo will use\n",
    "BigQuery Manged Iceberg Tables, Managed Apache Kafka and Apache Kafka Connect to ingest streaming data, Vertex AI for Generative AI queries on top of the data and Dataplex to govern tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will process the data to simulate bus rides. The original datasets describes `ridership` as passengers in bus stations. We created bus lines, but not the rides. This will be the goal of this notebook. We accomplish this using **Google's Cloud Serverless Apache Spark**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The processing will simulate `bus ridership` data, based on `bus station ridership` data. The `bus station ridership` shows passengers waiting at a given station at a given timestamp. Our PySpark processing pipelines will use Pandas UDFs, simulating a bus picking up those passengers while driving it's route. The routes for the buses are taken from the pre-made `bus_lines` table.\n",
    "\n",
    "All data in this notebook was prepared in the previous `part0` notebook, and loaded in `part1` notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note about Iceberg catalogs, and how spark can use them:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In part 1, we loaded tables to bigquery in Iceberg format. To do so, we used 2 different kind of tables: 1) Managed Iceberg tables for BigQuery & 2) External Iceberg Tables for BigQuery.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between them is that the managed tables are read-write for BigQuery, and read-only for spark (and other external engines) while the reverse is true for external tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "How to choose? If your main workloads are in BigQuery, and your datasets are created by BigQuery, use the managed tables, as BigQuery retains control on how tables are created, managed clustered etc. If your main workloads are in external engines, and are being written down to GCS by external tools like spark, use the external tables to mount the iceberg tables in BigQuery to make them readable by BigQuery to enable computation on that data.\n",
    "\n",
    "in order to read both types of tables, spark needs to access the metadata and the data itself - and it can do so in 2 ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) access the data through BigQuery: This method is no different then reading BigQuery native tables, using the [Spark-BigQuery-Connector](https://github.com/GoogleCloudDataproc/spark-bigquery-connector), which is already pre-loaded in GCP environments (Like Colab Enterprise). This means that spark will access both metadata and data, simply by accessing the BigQuery API, and use BigQuery compute slots in order to retrieve this data. **Pros:** access any data, regardless of storage, in the same way. **Cons:** uses BigQuery slots, hence effects costs differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) access the data through metadata on GCS: This method is the standard way to read Iceberg data, regardless of where it is stored - this means that we need to configure a catalog for spark, and tell it where the tables are stored in the iceberg format. Spark, using the `iceberg` libraries, will scan the catalogs for tables data and metadata. If the catalog was written by Spark, and is just accessible to BigQuery by external tables, we should be able to access the data the same way we written it before, using the same catalog. If the data is managed by BigQuery, we just need to make sure to expose the up-to-date metadata to spark, which means **exporting the metadata** to GCS, before starting the spark process. **Pros:** Not using BigQuery slots, keeps your processing pipelines consistent and costs to a minimum for data access. **Cons:** just more configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will access data in all different ways. We will configure the **external** catalog that was used in notebook 1 to write the `bus_lines` external table. We will configure the **BigQuery catalog** to read the `ridership` managed table. And we will read the `bus_stations` table directly through BigQuery, using BigQuery slots to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, in a real-world scenario, you will probably have some BigQuery centric pipelines, writing down data in Managed Iceberg tables, backed in one GCS bucket, and some Spark centric pipelines, writing down data in external tables, backed by another GCS bucket. And maybe some BigQuery data, that is NOT accessible by Iceberg (like native tables, views etc.). This notebook will demonstrate the ability to access all types of data in spark, while the next notebook will demonstrate accessing all types of data in BigQuery - **A truly unified Data Lakehouse**.\n"
